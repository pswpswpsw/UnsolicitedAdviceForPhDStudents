# Working for Yourself & Career Goals

### Q: Why should a student think from their boss's (advisor's) perspective?

A: By thinking like your boss, you become more well-rounded, learn to manage teams, make presentations, and gather useful information, which helps you grow beyond just research.

### Q: Should I aim to be a professor even if I'm unsure about that career path?

A: Yes, setting "being a distinguished professor" as a goal, even if you change your mind later, helps you develop valuable skills like leading big projects and handling pressure. This broadens your skillset significantly.

### Q: Is being a professor only about research?

A: Not at all. Only about 20% of a professor's role is academic research; the other 80% is communication. This includes learning quickly, asking good questions, and effectively conveying your ideas to others.

### Q: How do the skills gained from aiming to be a professor apply to an industry career?
A: The skills you develop, such as communication, project management, and critical thinking, are amplified and highly valuable in an industry setting.

# Hard Work & Opportunity
### Q: What should be the focus of hard work for a student?
A: Hard work isn't about becoming the "next big name." It's about making something happen and focusing on tangible results.

### Q: How should I approach research topics if I'm not finding new opportunities?
A: Instead of pursuing over-exploited topics or trying to replicate others' success, ask yourself: "What resources do I need to get things done?" (e.g., time, money, specific tools, other research).

# Advisor Relationships
### Q: How can I make meetings with my advisor efficient?
A: Be organized and come prepared. Instead of asking ambiguous questions, present a clear logic line and use slides to explain your discoveries since the last meeting.

### Q: What is my role in a project compared to my advisor's?
A: As a student, you are the most responsible person for your project. While your advisor provides suggestions, you are likely more hands-on and responsible for understanding every corner of your area and identifying gaps.

### Q: Should I expect my advisor to teach me how to write every line of code?
A: No, advisors are typically far removed from the day-to-day coding. They know what they want from the research, so meetings are more about sharing your results and insights, and less about detailed instructions.

# Project Execution & Publication
### Q: What should be my priority for my first project?
A: Focus on completing your first project as fast as possible. Getting it done, even if it's not perfect, will build your confidence and make subsequent projects easier.

### Q: When is it safe to share my research paper with others?
A: Only share your paper when it's on arXiv or with individuals you 100% trust. This helps prevent issues that many PhD students encounter.

### Q: What should I expect if I aim to publish in a top journal?
A: Expect to receive the biggest criticism from reviewers. This criticism isn't a negative; it's the most effective way for you to grow and improve your work.

# Perspective on Research & Famous People
### Q: Should I follow the research directions proposed by famous people?
A: Not necessarily. Famous people often become well-known by finding reasons for many people to get funded, not always by identifying the true bottlenecks. Instead, ask yourself: "What questions really matter? What stops our community from developing?"

### Q: What's the best way to present my research findings?
A: The best way to present is through contrast. Show "before and after" scenarios and provide clear metrics that quantify the improvement your work offers.

# Personal Growth & Continuous Learning
### Q: How should I interpret criticism from my advisor?
A: Advisor criticism is never personal. It simply means they need something you haven't provided or that your work needs refinement. It's not a judgment of your ability.

### Q: What is the main purpose of graduate school?
A: Graduate school is less about teaching and more about selection. You are expected to take the initiative, read widely, propose your own ideas, and make your advisor successful through your contributions.

### Q: Why is continuous reading important for a student?
A: Reading 1-2 papers daily (to grasp ideas and conclusions) will quickly reveal that new information becomes rarer, making it easy to catch up with and understand your field. It serves as your intellectual protection.

### Q: Does working on a "hot topic" guarantee importance?
A: Not necessarily. If you follow hot topics proposed by famous people, your work might only reinforce theirs. True impact comes from identifying your unique angle and addressing real community bottlenecks. While students often start by following, the goal is to gradually find your own unique contributions that stand out.
