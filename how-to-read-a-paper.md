> _"Research is a balance among reading a paper, trying out new ideas, and delivering the research outcome." - Shaowu Pan_

In academia, _"paper"_ stands for a document that summarizes the major scientific advancement from a group of researchers. I hope you all know why we read papers: **we need to know where we are before where to go**. I believe some of you have already "read" a paper. Maybe you feel reading papers is boring and painful. To me, reading papers is always a joy. Today, I am going to tell you how I read a paper. 

# Getting into a field with review papers

When you first step into a field, which paper to start? Fortunately, the leaders in the field have prepared it for you: review paper. Review papers are mostly invited only. That means the editor chooses the best one in the field and asks him to provide a thorough review o the status in this field. The review paper is a summary of important achievements from different aspects of the field. Here is a checklist when you read the review paper:
- [ ] what are the main ideas/motivations of this field?
- [ ] what are the most popular methods/models in the field?
- [ ] how do these models differ from each other? what are the advantages and disadvantages of each method?
- [ ] what kind of impact from this field to other fields? 
- [ ] what are the remaining challenges/unknowns in the field?
- [ ] what kind of progress in this field will make you excited?

# Read, fast and slow

> _Go to download a large number of papers and quickly read through the most essential parts. _

When you read a paper, you are looking for diamonds, not rocks. Before you want to dive deep, ask yourself, why read this paper and what do you expect to find? What's the most important thing in the paper? Fortunately, the authors have prepared it for you. For a quick going through, you just need to read the **abstract**, **_figures/tables_ and captions**,  **conclusion**. Then, you should know what problem the paper is trying to address and what's the solution to the problem. This is the so-called **read fast**. 

Everyone loves fast, ugh? Just like everyone loves fast food. Unfortunately, I saw some students just stop right here and "read fast" for every single paper for the rest of their life. They are not lucky enough to enjoy the excitement of research. 

> _Carefully read those critical papers and make sure you understand line by line_

You have to carefully read "A" paper in order to 
- learn useful mathematical tricks. Guess what? Those tricks can be reused. If you learned how to use them, it becomes your thing! 
- you will fully understand how to "build a Rome", although you cannot build it in one day. Then, all you need is, patience and persistence!
- appreciate the beauty of the "story" --- every good paper tells a wonderful and exciting story! Every good paper is to walk you through a great adventure! 

# Mathematics-oriented reading - "Eat this paper"

> _I feel I didn't read/remember anything, help!_
> _I cannot read such a mathy paper! I feel dizzy! I want to vomit!_ 

When reading a paper full of theorems and equations, first make sure this is a high-value paper (HVP). Otherwise, you will feel happy and regretful at the same time! If it is a paper that you want to read, now here is a bag of tricks for you:

- [ ] find a big table, lots of white papers + a good pen.
- [ ] start reading from the first place where Greek letters appear, write down whatever the author claims, and use your pen to derive what he claims! You can skip those steps that are not explained in the paper. 
- [ ] after you finish the derivation (which might take 4 hours), sit back and try to explain to yourself through the proof in your own words.  
- [ ] put down your pen. Ask yourself, can I derive these from the beginning? If not, what is missing? Try to close the gap between you and the author. 

# Programming-oriented reading

In my field, good papers are likely to accompany a Github repo. So you can reproduce the authors' results (which they took 1 year to finish) in one day. Feel good, yeah? If you have any implementation questions about the paper, now is the best time to sweep them all! Reading someone's code is not easy. But here I can tell you how I would tackle
- read the paper before the code. understand the big picture first.
- when looking at the code, first find a "thread" - this could be running a _example.py_ in this code. then, use your **PyCharm** IDE to turn on **debugging** mode, go to his code line by line, even into the very deep rabbit hole! Just to figure out how did he implement his "paper" with these lines of "code". It is possible that they wrote very fancy in the paper but things are pretty simple in the code! 
- if you still find it challenging to debug, I would recommend you "print the code" into a series of paper, then read line by line, and try to think about how these variables got updated across different functions/programs. How is the information transferred from one place to another? 

# What paper to read?
This is perhaps the most important step. If you find the wrong paper, no matter how good you are at reading papers, your time investment is going to be completely USELESS! 
- First, as your advisor, I will find one to three papers for you to read. You will learn the essential skills/knowledge from those. 
- Second, you use **GoogleScholar** to find **what papers cite those important paper that I sent you**. From that list, search for the latest OR the highly cited ones. Download those, and go to "Read, fast and slow".
