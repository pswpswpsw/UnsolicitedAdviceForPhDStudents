## Introduction

Pursuing a Ph.D. is no joke. It requires good working ethics, hardworking, and the most important thing - motivation and strong interests. Here is a couple of Q&A and tutorial/resources to get started specifically in my lab.

## Q & A

> **Q: What's the requirement of Ph.D. at MANE?**

Please take a look at this handbook (or the latest one), especially chapter 2
[MANE Graduate Student Handbook](https://mane.rpi.edu/student-resources/mane-graduate-student-services)

> **Q: How does the Ph.D. look like in this lab?**

Roughly speaking, 
- First semester, let's get started with some half-baked research either from me or senior students.
- At the end of first year - after the summer, you will have something to show as a conference paper or abstract.
- Second year, still the same as first year but you should take qualifying exam at the end of this year, called DQE. If you got a master before coming to RPI, you need to take it immediately after 1 year.
- In the beginning of the third year, you can start a wholesome literature review about a topic that interests you (while also aligned with my funded project). 
- Third year and fourth year: based on your literature review, find a niche topic to work on and develop your own research "zone"/"taste"/"style"
- Each year you will finish least one journal paper. So in total you need to have at least 3 first author journal paper during your Ph.D. Thesis (at least) 3 papers should be focused around the same big topic.
- Fifth year: team-up with junior Ph.D. students, working on research at the same time, and for the last semester - prepare the thesis, and I will organize the committee to find a date for defense. 

> **Q: What will be my working environment?**

We encourage a collaborative working environment while everyone has their own project. Our lab is located in JEC 5204 with workstation and whiteboard for derivations, idea brainstorming.

> **Q: What's the fastest way to get started on research?**

Read papers, read papers, read papers - find the pain points, "niche area", and then discuss your ideas with me.
Then, start to play around with existing code. **Get your hands dirty is the fastest way to learn**. Next, **break the algorithm** by pushing it to far extreme or situations that are out of the assumptions. Find solutions to solve them. Then you have a "story" - you just pushed the boundary of science! 

> **Q: How to be productive?**

Time management is very important. You are lucky because it will be too late to practice in the company. 
- 90 mins for a single work. Never, ever, multi-tasking. 
- Make a huge a block of continuously non-stopping time for research. Disable any cell phone, internet, etc. Just focus on coding and implement the algorithms. Don't mix reading paper with coding at the same day. 
- Make good use of your time from 9 to 6. 
- Maintain physical and emotional energy with good habits 

> **Q: What's your expectation, Professor Pan?**

The most important thing is that you should be an expert in this topic you choose better than me - and better than almost anyone else. I expect you to take the initiative to be successful and always being determined to be excellent among peers. Be persistent.
