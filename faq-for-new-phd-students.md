## Introduction

Pursuing a Ph.D. is no joke. It requires good work ethic, hard work, and most importantly—motivation and strong interests. Here are a couple of Q&As and tutorials/resources to get started, specifically in my lab.

## Q & A

> **Q: What's the requirement for a Ph.D. at MANE?**

Please take a look at this handbook (or the latest one), especially chapter 2:
[MANE Graduate Student Handbook](https://mane.rpi.edu/student-resources/mane-graduate-student-services)

> **Q: What does a Ph.D. look like in this lab?**

Roughly speaking:
- First semester: get started with some half-baked research, either from me or senior students.
- End of first year (after the summer): you will have something to show as a conference paper or abstract.
- Second year: similar to the first year, but you should take the qualifying exam at the end of this year, called DQE. If you got a master's before coming to RPI, you need to take it immediately after 1 year.
- Beginning of the third year: start a comprehensive literature review about a topic that interests you (aligned with my funded project).
- Third and fourth years: based on your literature review, find a niche topic to work on and develop your own research "zone"/"taste"/"style".
- Each year, you will finish at least one journal paper. In total, you need to have at least 3 first-author journal papers during your Ph.D. Thesis (at least 3 papers should be focused around the same big topic).
- Fifth year: team up with junior Ph.D. students, work on research, and in the last semester, prepare the thesis. I will organize the committee and find a date for your defense.

> **Q: What will be my working environment?**

We encourage a collaborative working environment while everyone has their own project. Our lab is located in JEC 5204, with workstations and a whiteboard for derivations and idea brainstorming.

> **Q: What's the fastest way to get started on research?**

Read papers, read papers, read papers—find the pain points, "niche area", and then discuss your ideas with me.
Then, start to play around with existing code. **Getting your hands dirty is the fastest way to learn.** Next, **break the algorithm** by pushing it to extreme situations that are outside the assumptions. Find solutions to solve them. Then you have a "story"—you just pushed the boundary of science!

> **Q: How can I be productive?**

Time management is very important. You are lucky because it will be too late to practice in the company.
- 90 minutes for a single work session. Never, ever, multitask.
- Make a huge block of uninterrupted time for research. Disable your cell phone, internet, etc. Just focus on coding and implementing algorithms. Don't mix reading papers with coding on the same day.
- Make good use of your time from 9 to 6.
- Maintain physical and emotional energy with good habits.

> **Q: What's your expectation, Professor Pan?**

The most important thing is that you should become an expert in your chosen topic—better than me, and better than almost anyone else. I expect you to take the initiative to be successful and always be determined to excel among your peers. Be persistent.
